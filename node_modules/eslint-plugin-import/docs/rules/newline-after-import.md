# import/newline-after-import

Enforces having one or more empty lines after the last top-level import statement or require call.
+(fixable) The `--fix` option on the [command line] automatically fixes problems reported by this rule.

## Rule Details

This rule has one option, `count` which sets the number of newlines that are enforced after the last top-level import statement or require call. This option defaults to `1`.

Valid:

```js
import defaultExport from './bar'

const FOO = 'BAR'
```

```js
import defaultExport from './bar'
import { bar }  from 'bar-lib'

const FOO = 'BAR'
```

```js
const FOO = require('./bar')
const BAR = require('./bar')

const BAZ = 1
```

Invalid:

```js
import * as bar from 'bar'
const FOO = 'BAR'
```

```js
import * as bar from 'bar'
const FOO = 'BAR'

import { bar }  from 'bar-lib'
```

```js
const FOO = require('./bar')
const BAZ = 1
const BAR = require('./bar')
```

With `count` set to `2` this will be considered valid:

```js
import defaultExport from './bar'


const FOO = 'BAR'
```

With `count` set to `2` these will be considered invalid:

```js
import defaultExport from './bar'
const FOO = 'BAR'
```

```js
import defaultExport from './bar'

const FOO = 'BAR'
```


## Example options usage
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "import/newline-after-import": ["error", { "count": 2 }]
  }
}
```


## When Not To Use It

If you like to visually group module imports with its usage, you don't want to use this rule.
