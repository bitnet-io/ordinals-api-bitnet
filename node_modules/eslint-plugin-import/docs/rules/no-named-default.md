# import/no-named-default

Reports use of a default export as a locally named import.

Rationale: the syntax exists to import default exports expressively, let's use it.

Note that type imports, as used by [Flow], are always ignored.

## Rule Details

Given:
```js
// bar.js
export default 'bar';
export const bar = 'baz';
```

...these would be valid:
```js
import bar from './bar.js';
import bar, { bar } from './bar.js';
```

...and these would be reported:
```js
// message: Using exported name 'bar' as identifier for default export.
import { default as bar } from './bar.js';
import { default as bar, bar } from './bar.js';
```
