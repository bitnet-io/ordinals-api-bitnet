# import/no-named-as-default

Reports use of an exported name as the locally imported name of a default export.

Rationale: using an exported name as the name of the default export is likely...

- *misleading*: others familiar with `bar.js` probably expect the name to be `bar`
- *a mistake*: only needed to import `bar` and forgot the brackets (the case that is prompting this)

## Rule Details

Given:
```js
// bar.js
export default 'bar';
export const bar = 'baz';
```

...this would be valid:
```js
import bar from './bar.js';
```

...and this would be reported:
```js
// message: Using exported name 'bar' as identifier for default export.
import bar from './bar.js';
```

For post-ES2015 `export` extensions, this also prevents exporting the default from a referenced module as a name within that module, for the same reasons:

```js
// valid:
export bar from './bar.js';

// message: Using exported name 'bar' as identifier for default export.
export bar from './bar.js';
```
